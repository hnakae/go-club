# The Basic Theory of Go

<div className="mt-2"/>

## Analyze the strength of stones to find the moves with strong follow ups.

<div className="mt-4"/>

This one is critical. As mentioned in the previous chapter, this is the cornerstone concept. If you read the basic concepts of Go (from 5 to 2), that's good but you can forget them all. Just remember this one. The reason why this concept is so emphasized, is that when you really break down and get to the essence of each of the other four concepts, what you will find is that they can all be explained by this one concept. 
<div className="mt-4"/>
For every move, analyze the strength of all stones in order to determine what moves are big and what moves are small. Whether it's sacrifice, attack, direction, shape, or follow ups, we can rely on the analysis of the strength of stones to find the biggest move. And this applies to every move in every game. 
<div className="mt-4"/>
Just like when you checkmate the king in chess and guarantee your victory, the moment you master this concept, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that you have a _comprehensive understanding of all the basic theories of go_. This is the basic theory that encompasses everything about Go.



<div className="mt-8"/>

## The golden rules

<div className="mt-4"/>

## 1) Moves near alive stones(strong stones) are small.

 <div className="mt-2"/>

## 2) Moves without the threat of a follow up are small.

<div className="mt-8"/>

We can rephrase these two key points like this as well:

<div className="mt-4"/>

## 1) Moves near stones that aren't alive(weak stones) are big.

<div className="mt-2"/>

## 2) Moves with the threat of a follow up are big.

<div className="mt-8"/>

When stones are not yet alive, they are weaker and we can expect to find follow up moves. Thus, moves in this are are big.

<div className="mt-8"/>

## Example 1

Let's look at some examples, and along the way I'll show how this concept can be connected to the other basic concepts.

<ImageText src="/assets/blog/theory1/1.PNG" text1="White has just played this knight's move to check black's group here on the bottom side. If you guessed that the jump from one of these two black stones was the right move, I think you have an understanding of the 5 concepts.
" text2="Direction of Play - Rule #1: Play from your weak groups. Since black's group here is checked on both sides and there is a 2nd line stone due to the Q3 kick, Black's two stones have little eye-space and is unstable. So, we want to move from these guys since they're not alive and consequently weak."/>

<div className="mt-8"/>

<ImageText src="/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-15.PNG" text1="Perhaps you've noticed, that `play from your weak groups`, is the same as `Moves near weak stones are big`. We play from the weak group not only because of good direction, but also to limit the opponent's options by defending against moves with follow ups .
" text2="We can also say `push weak stones towards our strength`, is the same as `Moves near strong stones are small` because we are effectively pushing weak stones towards our strength and making the opponent play moves that lack follow up."/>


<div className="mt-8"/>

## Example 1: Options A & B

<div className="mt-4"/>

Now back to the example at hand, the one space jump from one of these stones would be the most orthodox response, but the problem here is there are two options for where to jump from. Here are the two options.

<div className="mt-2"/>

<div className="mt-2"/>

Using the two guidelines, 

<div className="mt-2"/>


## 1) Moves near alive stones are small.

<div className="mt-2"/>

## 2) Moves without the threat of a follow up are small.

<div className="mt-2"/>

Which is the correct answer, A or B?

<div className="mt-8"/>

## Correct Answer

<div className="mt-4"/>

<ImageText src="/assets/blog/theory1/a.PNG" text1="How did you do, did you get it right?
The correct answer (A) is to jump from the right side." text2="Perhaps you think that they're both one space jumps from the same group and so they're the same, but the nuance between these two moves effect the win rate by 6%. If you play A, white has about a 56% chance to win the game. But if you play B, white has about a 62% chance to win the game, according to katago on my machine."/>


Using the two key points of the strength of stones, we'll analyze why jumping from the stone on the right is better.

<div className="mt-4"/>

<ImageText src="/assets/blog/theory1/a.PNG" text1="First of all, moves near alive stones are small.
Between the knight's move enclosure on the bottom left corner and the three stones in the bottom right quadrant, which of these two white groups is not alive?" text2="The enclosure on the left side is stable. It's alive. but the group on the right side has no eye shape and is a weak group. Therefore, instead of playing near the alive enclosure, playing near the weak group has more value."/>

## Wrong Answer

 <ImageText src="/assets/blog/theory1/b.PNG" text1="So this move, is playing near the alive group." text2="And, because you played near an alive group, you have no real follow up."/>


## Follow Moves against Weak Group

<div className="mt-4"/>

![image info](/assets/blog/theory1/options.png)

For example: if white tenukis (plays elsewhere), black can knight's move or cap.

<div className="mt-8"/>

![image info](/assets/blog/theory1/5-options.png)

And even if white jumps again from the weak group, black can wedge to create these two cutting points.

<div className="mt-8"/>

## Example 1 Recap

So although the two one space jumps were both just one space jumps from the same group, we can find the better move if we use this universal concept. I hope that now you see that jumping from the right side near the weak group aiming at the many follow up moves is the better move.

![image info](/assets/blog/theory1/comparison1.png)

Once again, among the basic concepts of go, this one trumps them all by a landslide so let's look at another example to further consolidate this concept.

<div className="mt-8"/>

## Example 2

<div className="mt-4"/>

Black to play.

<div className="mt-2"/>

![image info](/assets/blog/theory1/6.PNG)


<div className="mt-8"/>

 <ImageText src="/assets/blog/theory1/7.PNG" text1="What do you think of this move? In terms of direction of play, black is playing according to 'play from your weak stones'. But, it contradicts the concept of the strength of stones. " text2="If you can see how this move is contradicting the strength of stones, you have a pretty solid understanding of what moves are big or not."/>



Let's analyze the strength of the white group in the top left quadrant. It's pretty much invincible because there it's fully connected up, with plenty of eye shape. We can say that it's alive. 

<div className="mt-2"/>

## 1) Moves near alive stones are small.

<div className="mt-2"/>

## 2) Moves without the threat of a follow up are small.

<ImageText src="/assets/blog/theory1/7.PNG" text1="This move is playing towards strong, alive stones." text2="Which means there's no immediate follow up threat. So ultimately, this follows `play from weak stones` but is actually a small move."/>


Interestingly, we can even say that this move contradicts 'Push your opponent's weak stones towards your strong stones'. 

<div className="mt-2"/>

<ImageText src="/assets/blog/theory1/7.PNG" text1="Essentially, this large knight move is approaching white's strong group, and so from white's perspective, the opponent has just pushed himself into your strength for you!" text2="How generous. From this explanation, I think it is clear to see that black's large knight move here is actually bad direction, despite it looking reasonable at first glance."/>

Additionally, the theory behind Sacrifice stones covered in chapter 1 can be explained by this concept of big and small moves based on the strength of stones.

<ImageText src="/assets/blog/theory5/part1/theory5-1.PNG" text1="When we revisit this problem from the article on Sacrifice stones, we now see more clearly why white's marked stone was a mistake." text2="White is going after stones that are near an alive group. So although the move presses black against his strong stones, black knows stones in that area will be small anyways. Thus, white won't get the flow that he is aiming for. "/>



So what would be a better move?

## Example 2: Answers

<div className="mt-4"/>

### Option A

<ImageText src="/assets/blog/theory1/8.PNG" text1="Because we don't want to approach white's thickness, this jump clearly commits to moving away from it. This move also helps increase the odds of the bottom side turning into a territory-moyo. And if not, this sort of position will aid in the fight when white jumps in to break it up." text2=""/>


### Option B

<ImageText src="/assets/blog/theory1/9.PNG" text1="If you don't consider the center group weak, playing like this is also valid, but anyways when you consider the concept of the strength of stones, either of these moves would be better than willingly pressing yourself against the opponent's strong group." text2=""/>



# Recap
