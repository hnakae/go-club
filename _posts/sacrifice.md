## How to determine scrap stones

On what basis do we determine whether a stone is scrap or not?
How do we know if a stone is valuable and must be saved, or if a stone should be thrown away and sacrificed? This question may sound absurdly simple to the point that it may sound like an insult to your intelligence, but I promise that knowing with certainty whether a stone can be sacrificed or not, is more rare than it may seem. There are many dan level players who would not be able to give you a concrete response. And, in the middle of a chaotic game with time pressure, this lack of clarity leads these dan players to make the mistake of saving stones which should not have been saved.

1 Stones that are stuck to alive stones.

2 Stones that were played as kikashi(forcing moves).

Using these two conditions, we must determine if a stone is scrap or not. Of course there are exceptions, but on a fundamental level, this is what we use to judge if a stone is scrap or not.

---

Let's take a look at some examples to clarify these two conditions.

## Starting with Condition #1:

Stones that are stuck to alive groups.

Take a look at this game state. In the top left quadrant, we can see that the two black stones in the corner are dead, making the D16 cutting stone irrelevant. Given this analysis, we know that all of white's stones are completely alive. So this means that all of the stones that are attached to the alive white group are scrap! More specifically, the three stones that white just played against are scrap.

Although those stones are scrap, white is making the mistake of trying to capture the scrap. In this moment, black can play well and not make the mistake white made.

Since we will not be saving scrap stones, we can play this one space jump to quickly develop the upper right and also roughly connect up with G12.

---

If for example white continues to threaten the scrap stones, just to be consistent with his initial plan, black can say thank you for going after scrap stones, and then play away to develop the biggest area of the board.

like so. And if white plays C14 to capture the three stones now, it would be a slow, low value, and low impact move.

On the other hand, let's see what will happen if black does save the scrap stones. Black hane,

white hane,

black connect.

black has saved the three stones that are attached to white's alive group, but there is nothing that black can hope to achieve by doing so. Saving the three stones won't give him anything to aim at in the corner, because those two black stones are dead. So there is no utility in saving this null cutting stone.

Not only that, but white can play this kind of continuation to separate the entire group from the right side. Black has just increased his burden for nothing in return.

now behold the difference this makes.

This is the meaning of Condition #1, Stones stuck to alive groups are scrap.

## Let's now take a look at an example to understand Condition #2

![image info](/assets/blog/theory5/part2/theory5-9.PNG)

Take a look at this game state. In this moment, black has an unstable group that is mostly surrounded, and the main topic is how he will settle this group.

---

So, black turns and threatens to capture one stone to try and make his two eyes for life.

White's next move is the theme for this example.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory5/part2/theory5-11.PNG)

Here, white saves this one stone and here, we must determine if this stone was scrap or not.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory5/part2/theory5-12.PNG)

To figure this out, it would be unfair to not see how the moves in this area played out so let's back track and see.

Black had just played this tiger's mouth.

---

white peeps

![image info](/assets/blog/theory5/part2/theory5-14.PNG)

black connects.

I think some of you get it now.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory5/part2/theory5-10.PNG)

If we go back to the original board position, we can now see that this white stone that black has turned around was a stone that was played as a kikashi, or forcing move. (The peep forcing the connection.)

Which means, that this stone falls under condition #2 for determining scrap stones.

And since we can't be saving scrap stones, white has to be overjoyed to sacrifice this stone.

The correct move here is to play the kosumi and completely seal black in, forcing black to take the scrap stone.

---

When black does take the one scrap stone,
White can just appreciate the fact that black just played a painfully small move.

---

After relishing in the fact that your opponent was forced to play a painfully small move, you can go ahead and play the biggest area on the board, completely outpacing the opponent.

From black's perspective, he has just captured one scrap stone for a grand total of 2 points, while white has completed the surround in sente, made the weak stick on the bottom side of the board strong via the relationship between it and the surrounding stones, and invaded the corner.

---

But let's see what it looks like if white saves the scrap stone.

![image info](/assets/blog/theory5/part2/theory5-18.PNG)

Black attaches to escape the surround, and all of a sudden white's group on the right is disconnected and isolated within black's moyo.

---

Finally, let's see the two results side by side.

![image info](/assets/blog/theory5/part2/theory5-comparison2.png)

The difference is night and day.

Using the two conditions:

1 Stones that are stuck to alive stones are scrap.

2 Stones that were played as kikashi are scrap.

![image info](/assets/blog/theory5/part2/theory5-comparison2.png)

Let's make sure that we correctly determine whether a stone is scrap or not, because the difference it makes puts this theory of scrap stones at number 5 in my top 5 fundamental theories.
