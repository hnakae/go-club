## Basic Concept of Go #2: Shape

---

This is a comprehensive list of bad shapes which you must avoid at all costs. If you aren't aware of these shapes and the shapes repeatedly come up in your games, these inefficiencies will hold you back so much that it will practically nullify your joseki/tsumego/tesuji studies.

Perhaps there are some people that question the importance of shapes. Is it really that important? Of course there are cases where playing the bad shape turns out to be a good move, but if you ignore shape, the efficiency of your stones will go down. So such cases are the rare exception. It is highly advisable, to just remember these shapes and simply play accordingly. Of course the rare exceptions do exist, but the important thing to prioritize here is to learn how to play, using the proper form. Then and only then, do we start remembering the exceptions. If we don't approach it in this order, there will be no traction and nothing will stick.

And finally, here are the 5 shapes you must avoid.

The Empty Triangle.

The representative bad shape. If you don't understand why the empty triangle is bad, you can just say 'this move is bad because it's an empty triangle'. For now. The priority is to make it a habit to not play bad shape.

Here are some more examples.
