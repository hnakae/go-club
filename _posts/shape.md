## Basic Concept of Go #2: Shape

---

This is a comprehensive list of bad shapes which you must avoid at all costs. If you aren't aware of these shapes and the shapes repeatedly come up in your games, these inefficiencies will hold you back so much that it will practically nullify your joseki/tsumego/tesuji studies.

Perhaps there are some people that question the importance of shapes. Is it really that important? Of course there are cases where playing the bad shape turns out to be a good move, but if you ignore shape, the efficiency of your stones will go down. So such cases are the rare exception. It is highly advisable, to just remember these shapes and simply play accordingly. Of course the rare exceptions do exist, but the important thing to prioritize here is to learn how to play, using the proper form. Then and only then, do we start remembering the exceptions. If we don't approach it in this order, there will be no traction and nothing will stick.

And finally, here are the 5 shapes you must avoid.

## The Empty Triangle.

The representative bad shape. If you don't understand why the empty triangle is bad, you can just say 'this move is bad because it's an empty triangle'. For now. The priority is to make it a habit to not play bad shape.

Here are some more examples.

White extend. Now the problem here is how to respond without making bad shape.

This response covers for the connection, but as you can see, black has formed an empty triangle.

Here's another response that results in an empty triangle in black's shape.

So looking past the previous two ways, we come across this response. This time, we avoided making an empty triange. We instead have a good shape, called a bamboo joint. This automatically moves this response up to the top of our list, compared to our previous two ideas.

This is an indirect response that you could think of to avoid the empty triangle, but it does leave behind a weakness. According to katago, the previous move is the best candidate, but this move would be better than making an empty triangle.

## The Split Shape

I think this one you've seen, an all too common mistake that allows the shape to be completely broken.
Similar to the empty triangle, there are exceptions to the rule, but the first priority is to learn to play the game while avoiding this split shape.

This too, is an example of split shape. So if your opponent is able to play in between your stones and move through your shape, it is considered a split shape. When you opponent goes in between the two stones and splits them apart, both stones immediately become stale. They no longer serve the player's position in an effective way. There are reasons for this, but first and foremost, it's easiest to treat it as a rule of law and just remember that the split shape is bad shape. It's like the law that you must have a driver's license to drive a vehicle on public roads. Of course, if someone is in critical condition and needs immediate medical attention, someone who in practice could drive the person to the hospital but does not have a license, would be a legitimate exception case to the rule. But if everyone were to ignore this law because there are exceptions to the case, there will be casualties and chaos. So if you play the split shape with an awareness that this is an exception to the rule, and the resolve to play it anyways with full acceptance of the risks associated, things are a bit different, but if the awareness and distinction is not there, and blindly play the split shape, your go will not take form and will crumble. So please make it a habit to not play the split shape.

Let's look at an example of how this shape may arise in your games.
white has just played in between these two black stones. And here, black has to be careful to avoid the split one space jump and the split knight's move shape introduced earlier. Let's first take a look at the two responses that black must not play.

---

As you can see, these two responses by black give white the clear cut follow up to split your shape apart.

---

This is now white's only move. And black has the split shape.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory2/16.PNG)

Looking at this shape, we see that here too, white has an only move. and black is broken.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory2/14.PNG)

So in this position, our goal is to avoid the above two moves and find another way.

---

Rather than pushing to give white the only move, black can back off like this and the result is much better.

And rather than pushing from above, lightly playing the knight's move is much better.
