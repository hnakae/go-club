## How to find us

Look for the gobans and listen for the clacking of slate and shell. We'll be on the west side near Magpie Coffee.

## About the articles

Read them in this order:

Proverb - This will be one of many articles on various proverbs. Read this before Attack.

Sacrifice - This is #5 in the top 5 go concepts to know.

Attack - This is #4

Direction of Play - #3

Shape - #2

The Strength of Stones - #1

---

The articles are intended to be read in this order because the concepts build upon eachother with references to the previous concepts to provide opportunities for review. By the time you get to #1, you will have a comprehensive understanding of all the basic concepts of go.

The intended audience is for these articels is kyu players and low dan players.

If you are brand new, I recommend reading shape, as this one requires the least amount of experience to appreciate.

Happy reading!
