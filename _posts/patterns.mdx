# A Breakdown of Patterns

<div className="mt-4"/>

## Preface

<div className="mt-2"/>

I was reading Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, when I realized that the content in this book to some extent had some interesting takeaways that were transferable to the game of Go, so I wanted to share it with the Eugene Go Club as food for thought.

"One thing expert designers know not to do is solve every problem from first principles.
Rather, they reuse solutions that have worked for them in the past. When they find a
good solution, they use it again and again."

## What is a Pattern?

{/* <div className="mt-2"/> */}

At the core of patterns is a solution to a problem in a context.

<div className="mt-4"/>

In general, a pattern has four essential elements:

1. The **pattern name**
2. The **problem**
3. The **solution**
4. The **consequences**

## Describing Patterns

<div className="mt-4"/>

**Pattern Name and Classification**

A good name is vital, because it will become part of your pattern vocabulary.
<div className="mt-2"/>

**Intent**
    
What does the pattern do? What is its rationale and intent? What issue or problem does it address?
<div className="mt-2"/>

**Also Known As**
    
Well known names for the pattern
<div className="mt-2"/>
**Motivation**
    
illustrate a scenario where a pattern solves a problem. This illustration will help you later with more abstract descriptions of patterns
<div className="mt-2"/>
**Applicability**
    
In what situations can the pattern be applied? How can you recognize these situations?
<div className="mt-2"/>
**Structure**
    
illustrate the interactions and collaborations in detail.
<div className="mt-2"/>
**Participants**
    
Objects participating in the pattern and their responsibilities
<div className="mt-2"/>
**Collaborations**
    
How participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities
<div className="mt-2"/>
**consequences**
    
How does the pattern support its objectives? What are the trade-offs and results of using the pattern? 
<div className="mt-2"/>
**Implementation**
    
What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be aware of when implementing the pattern?
<div className="mt-2"/>
**Concrete examples**

a, b, c

**Known Uses found in pro games**

**Related Patterns**

What patterns are closely related to this one? What are the important differences? With which other patterns should this one be used?
