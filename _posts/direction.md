Given this game state where black has just played the attach, the question is, what is the correct direction of play here?

The first thing we need to recognize is the strength of each of the groups. Which groups are weak? Which groups are strong?

If we can't judge the strenth and weakness of a group, we won't be able to use the two fundamental theories of direction of,

1 play from your weak group.

2 push your opponent's weak group against your strong group.

in order to make the correct decision.

---

For this reason, we'll first take a look at each of the groups on this board.

We'll look at black's groups first. First of all, the upper left and upper right corners are alive and strong. Also the large knight enclosure in the bottom right is pretty stable so we can call that a strong group as well. The one extension stone at R9 has a connection in either side in miai, so it's not a weak stone that we will need to worry about. This leaves us with the one group in the center. It has no base and no eye shape. It's a floating weak group.

Now let's look at white' groups. The group on the upper side is fully connected up, and it has a lot of territory (eye space) so it is a strong group. Based on how you look at it, you could even treat it as a wall of thickness. The one stone on the star point in the bottom left is left alone so it's strong for now. So this leaves us with the one group in the center.

This white group in the center as it is in the moment carries this weakness.

If white responds by defending the cutting point,

Black can jump.
And white is left with zero eyes.

Given this reality, this white group cannot be considered strong.
It's more like an unstable group because the eye shape is not there yet.
So we can say that this group is a weak group.

Great, so now we've checked the status of all groups on the board for both sides.
White has a weak group in the center so we'll have to care for it as we play our next moves. With this in mind, we'll look at the two fundamental theories of direction.

Rule #1: Move from your weak group.

Following rule #1, playing from the center group that doesn't have clear eye shape yet, is the right direction of play.

Rule #2: Press your opponent's weak group against your wall, thickness, or strong group.

Following rule #2, playing to press black's weak group against white's strong group will be the right direction of play.

We are both playing from white's unstable group in the center, and pushing black's weak group against white's strong group.

Black doesn't have much of an option here but to respond by extending...

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-7.PNG)

But white will just keep pushing with the image of pressing black against white's strong group.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-8.PNG)

Black again has not much of an option but to keep his head out to prevent being surrounded...

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-9.PNG)

But once again, white pushes from the weak group and pushes black's weak group against white's thickness.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-10.PNG)

Continued by black extend.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-11.PNG)

White keeps on pushing black against white's strong group.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-12.PNG)

Black extends.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-13.PNG)

And since what matters here is direction of play, we push yet again with no problem.
Remember, white's group on the top side of the board is very strong. So we will push the opponent's group against it.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-14.PNG)

Black doesn't have much other than to extend again,

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-15.PNG)

And around here white can follow through by playing a knights move down to the third line. Now observe how black's direction of play is completely uninteresting. Not only is black getting pressed into an un-interesting direction, white with every move, is building a massive thickness towards the center.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-16.PNG)

And so even if black adds another move to somehow save this group from dieing, white can just take sente here and play somewhere on the bottom side of the board to turn the thickness he has made into a ji-moyo.

---

Now let's see what would happen if white plays from the wrong direction of play.

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-17.PNG)

White jumps from strong group.

1 play from your weak group.

2 push your opponent's weak group against your strong group.

We can clearly see that white is moving from the strong group, breaking the first fundamental rule of direction.

---

Because of white's direction of play, black now gets to hane here against white's weak group.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-19.PNG)

White extends to save the stone...

---

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-20.PNG)

But black will now return to this bumping move and secure a clean escape out into the center, leaving white's center group in an unsettling state.

---

Finally, let's compare the two outcomes.

![image info](/assets/blog/theory3/theory3-comparison.png)

As you can see, one mistake in direction of play can completely change the flow of the game. So analyze the strength and weakness of the groups on the board for both sides and use the two rules:

1 play from your weak group.

2 push your opponent's weak group against your strong group.

to correctly determine the right direction of play.
