Here are 20 proverbs that will serve as the foundation for the start of your journey to Go mastery. I'll use visual examples...

So let me ask you a question. What do you think is the reason that causes people not to improve? Is it because they don't know joseki? Or perhaps it's because they can't play the tesuji or do tsumego? If this was your answer, unfortunately, these aren't the reasons. Of course, tesuji and tsumego are undeniably reliable methods for improvement, but before we even go there, we need to address the foundation: how to think in Go and understand shapes.

The 20 proverbs I will share with you today contain the foundational concepts distilled within and will serve to grow your roots so that your future development is well supported. If you do not know, understand, and grasp these proverbs, your studies in Joseki, Tesuji, and reading will be meaningless for your improvement. Not only will they not be effective for your progress, but it will also just be a waste of your time. But don't worry, because here are the 20 proverbs that you need to know.

But who is this guy to make such a claim? Sure, I may not be a professional or anything close to it, but I have reached 6 dan on Fox Weiqi and Tygem (the two largest Go servers) by following these guiding principles.

Starting with proverb #20. This one is on the topic of how to think in Go. The proverb goes like this: "Don't try to surround territory with thickness." You may have heard of this one, but I assume many of you may not fully understand it. For those of you who want a concrete understanding of this proverb, here are some examples to melt away the confusion like ice on a hot summer day. Once you grasp the image of what 'surrounding territory with thickness' looks like, you will clearly see what "Don't try to surround territory with thickness" is warning you of.

Let me start with a metaphor. Thickness is a factory. I know this is strange, but Go is like a business. In this business of Go, we must use our assets (thickness in this case) to generate profit. First of all, thickness won't be just 1 or 2 stones. Generally, it will be closer to 5-10 stones, give or take some, and they are like the many robots and machines within a factory. And in these factories, all of these individual things work together to be a factory. So given this factory, how do we make a profit? Of course, just having the factory is not going to generate profit. We have to use it somehow. Hopefully, we can generate maybe 10, 15, or 20 points with the factory. We have the land, the building, and the machines, and somehow we need to convert this into cash. Now we have two options:

We produce products with the factory and sell the products for cash.
We sell the factory.
Regarding converting thickness into profit, we also have two options:

We use the thickness in an attack.
We settle for grabbing territory with the thickness.
Perhaps you already get where I'm going with this. Factories are for creating products to sell to generate profit. They aren't meant to generate that cash by selling the land, the building, or the machines. It's not that we can't sell the factory, but if we do, we're probably already in the red. And so this is the way to think about thickness. To surround territory with thickness is like selling the factory. This conversion is not the intended purpose of a factory. If we use the factory as intended, we can generate more profit than if we sell it. Of course, we can sell the factory, but if we just use the factory to generate an attack, this attack converts into more profit than just selling the factory.

And this is the essence of "Don't try to surround territory with thickness."

Now, with this in mind, let's look at some examples.

Take a look at the above example. If you look at the top right quadrant, we see a massive thickness for black. And on the right side, near the center, white has a weak group. Now let's think about how we can use this thickness to generate an attack!

There are many options here, but here is one move that has many good follow-ups.

One follow-up that the move aims at is this: to put some pressure on white's 4 stones on the bottom with a surround.

So a natural response by white would be to defend by preventing black from playing the above continuation.

Black then continues by capping the weak group in the center. You could say that the cap is the epitome of an attacking move. Let's see how this unfolds.

White attaches to the capping stone and tries to settle his group, but black is fine just pushing white towards his thickness.

Now that black has used his thickness to attack (cap and surround), he has generated a secondary thickness facing the left side of the board. Since his factory has now generated a new factory, we can say that the attack was profitable! Black has generated his products, and now it's time to cash out. Black takes up position on the left side with two approach moves and the star point on the side. But what is the difference between the first thickness and this second thickness? Why do we try to make this second thickness territory? Doesn't it go against everything I just explained? Well, let me introduce you to the distinction between a moyo and a ji-moyo. Simply put, there is thickness and then there is thickness that is likely to become a lot of territory.

Let's go back to black's first move and play to surround territory with the thickness instead of attacking and see how this looks. Black plays this knight's move to surround territory with the wall.

White responds and black responds, staying consistent with his plan to make any territory that he can with the wall.

White then roughly connects up with his bottom group and stabilizes the center group which was once a weak group.

![image info](/assets/blog/proverb20/proverb20-6.PNG)

Let's compare this result with the variation where black attacks instead. Black uses his wall to attack and surround white, and in exchange for losing the potential to make territory in that area where white ends up living, black has generated a new wall which creates a ji-moyo like below.

As you can probably tell, this result from attacking the weak group with the wall looks like there will be more profit than trying to surround territory with the wall in the first place.

When you can use your thickness to attack a weak group to create a second wall to build a ji-moyo, we are using the factory as intended (to produce a ji-moyo) rather than selling it off.

And this is the essence of how to think about thickness! Finally, let's look at the two results side by side and really take in the difference.

The difference is astonishing, isn't it?

This is why "Don't surround territory with thickness" is such an important proverb. Using the factory for its intended purpose to generate more profit in the game of Go looks like this.

Of course, there are exceptions, but gaining in-game experience will sort that out. As long as you understand this proverb, this will not be the thing that holds back your progress in learning and improving. Please remember this proverb.
