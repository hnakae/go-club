## Preface

Here's #20 out of the top 20 proverbs that will serve as the foundation for the start of your journey to Go mastery. I recommend reading this one first, and work your way up the list to get the most out of this series. By the end of the series, you will have the foundational knowledge that will serve as the spring board for your future success in go.

So let me ask you a question. What do you think is the reason that causes people not to improve? Is it because they don't know joseki? Or perhaps it's because they can't find the tesuji or do tsumego? If this was your answer, (unfortunately), these aren't the reasons. Of course, tesuji and tsumego are undeniably reliable methods for improvement, but before we even go there, we need to address the foundation: how to think in Go and understand shapes.

The 20 proverbs I'll share with you contain fundamental concepts that will serve to grow your roots so that your future development is well supported and unhindered. If you do not know, understand, and grasp these proverbs, your studies in Joseki, Tesuji, and reading will be meaningless for your improvement. Not only will they not be effective for your progress, but it will also just be a waste of your time. But don't worry, because here are the 20 proverbs that you need to know.

But who is this guy to make such a claim? Sure, I may not be a professional or anything close to it, but I've reached 6 dan on Fox Weiqi and Tygem (the two largest Go servers) by following these guiding principles, and I believe that if you take these lessons to heart, that there is nothing stopping you from reaching a similar level or beyond.

Starting with proverb #20. This one is on the topic of how to think in Go. The proverb goes like this:

## "Don't surround territory with thickness."

You may have heard of this one, but I assume many of you may not fully understand it. For those of you who want a concrete understanding of this proverb, I'll use an example to melt away any confusion. Once you grasp the image of what 'surrounding territory with thickness' looks like, you will clearly see the essence of the proverb, "Don't surround territory with thickness".

---

Let me start with a metaphor. Thickness is a factory.

I know this is strange, but Go is like a business. In this business of Go, we must use our assets (thickness in this case) to generate profit. First of all, thickness won't be just 1 or 2 stones. Generally, it will be closer to 5-10 stones, give or take some, and they are like the many robots and machines within a factory. And in these factories, all of these individual things work together to be a factory.

So given this factory, how do we make a profit? Of course, just having the factory is not going to generate profit. We have to use it somehow. Hopefully, we can generate maybe 10, 15, or 20 points with the factory. We have the land, the building, and the machines, and somehow we need to convert this into cash.

Now, we have two options with the factory:

1. 1 - We produce products with the factory and sell the products for cash. or...
2. 2 - We sell the factory for cash.

And with thickness, also two options:

1. 1 - We use the thickness in an attack, and profit with the attack.
   or...
2. 2 - We settle for grabbing territory with the thickness.

Perhaps you already get where I'm going with this. Factories are for creating products to sell to generate profit. They aren't meant to generate that cash by selling the land, the building, or the machines. It's not that we can't sell the factory, but if we do, we're probably already in the red.

And so this is the way to think about thickness. To surround territory with thickness is to sell the factory. This conversion is not the intended purpose of a factory. If we use the factory as intended, we can generate more profit than if we sell it. Of course, we can sell the factory, but if we just use the factory to generate an attack, this attack converts into more profit than just selling the factory.

And this is the essence of "Don't surround territory with thickness."

Now, with this in mind, let's take a look at a concrete example.

Take a look at the above game state. If you look at the top right quadrant, we see a massive thickness for black. And on the right side, near the center, white has a weak group. Now let's think about how we can use this thickness to generate an attack!

There are many options here, but here is one move that has many good attacking follow-ups.

One follow-up that the move aims at is this: to threaten the four white stones on the bottom with a surround.

---

So a natural response by white would be to defend by preventing black from playing the above continuation.

---

Black then continues by capping the weak group in the center. You could say that the cap is the epitome of an attacking move. Let's see how this unfolds.

White attaches to the capping stone and tries to settle his group, but black is fine just pushing white towards his thickness. It's suspicious whether white is alive here, but black isn't aiming to profit from the attack by killing this group.

What black is actually aiming for with this attack is to create territory.
Now that black has used his thickness to attack (cap and surround), he has generated a secondary thickness facing the left side of the board. Black takes up position on the left side with two approach moves and the star point on the side...

But what's the difference between the first thickness and this second thickness? Why do we try to make this second thickness territory? Doesn't it go against everything I just explained? Well, let me introduce you to the distinction between a moyo and a ji-moyo.

Simply put, there is thickness and then there is thickness that is likely to become a lot of territory.

Let's go back to black's first move and play to surround territory with the thickness instead of attacking and see how this looks. Black plays this knight's move to surround territory with the wall.

---

White responds and black responds, staying consistent with his plan to make any territory that he can with the wall.

---

White then roughly connects up and we can see, that black has gained a little bit of territory, minus what white got, adding up to very little profit in total. It's hard to call this a ji-moyo, or thickness that is likely to become a lot of territory. It was just a moyo.

---

Let's compare this result with the variation where black attacks instead. Black uses his wall to attack and surround white, and in exchange for losing the potential to make territory in that area where white ends up living, black has generated a new wall which can be used to create a ji-moyo(territory-moyo).

---

![image info](/assets/blog/proverb20/proverb20-9.PNG)

As you can probably tell, this result from attacking the weak group with the wall has a good relationship with the three stones black played on the left side, and the result will likely be more profitable than trying to surround territory with the wall in the first place.

When you can use your thickness to attack a weak group to create a second wall to build a ji-moyo with, we are using the factory as intended to generate the most profit, and this is the essence of how to think about thickness.

Finally, let's look at the two results side by side and really take in the difference.

---

![image info](/assets/blog/proverb20/proverb20-13.PNG)

The difference is astonishing, isn't it?
On the left, Black is up by 9.5 points with a 96.7% chance to win this game, according to Katago.
On the right, White is up by 8.3 points with a 96.4% chance to win.

This is why "Don't surround territory with thickness" is such an important proverb, putting it at #20 in my top 20 proverbs. Using the factory for its intended purpose to generate more profit, in the game of Go, looks like this.

Of course, there are exceptions, but gaining in-game experience will sort that out. As long as you understand this proverb, you can be assured that improper use of thickness will not be the thing that holds back your progression. Please remember this proverb.

I hope that this article served to clarify this proverb regarding the use of thickness, and also to serve as food for thought and inspiration for your next game, online or IRL at our club on Wednesdays. Thank you for reading this article to the very end. If you got this far, let me know what you think! -Hiro
