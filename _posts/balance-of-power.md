## Basic Concepts of Go #1: The Strength of Stones

---

This one is crucial. If you read the basic concepts of go : # 4 through 2, good, but you can forget them all, just remember this one concept. The reason why this concept on the strength of stones is so important, is that when you really break down and get to the essence of each of the other four concepts, what you will find is that they are all connected by this one concept. So all of the basic concepts of go that I shared in my previous articles can be derived from here.

Just like when you checkmate the king in chess, and guarantee your victory, the moment you master this concept, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that you now have a _comprehensive understanding of all the basic theories of go_. This is the basic theory that encompasses everything about Go.

So let's get on with the two key points:

1 Moves near living stones are small.

2 Moves without the threat of a follow up are small.

---

These are the two. Burn these into your memory so that when you wake up from this simulation you still remember it.
These two points share a close relationship.

When it comes to living stones, they're obviously already alive so there is no attack that you can aim for. Basically there isn't much of a follow up that you can threaten against such a group. Thus, moves in this area are small.

---

We can rephrase these two key points like this as well:

1 Moves near stones that aren't alive are big.

2 Moves with the threat of a follow up are big.

---

When stones are not yet alive, we can expect to be able to threaten a follow up move. Thus, moves in this are are big.

---

Let's look at some examples, and along the way I'll show how this concept can be connected to the other basic concepts.
