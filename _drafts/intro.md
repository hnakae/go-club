## Intro

So let me start by asking you a question. What do you think is the reason that causes people not to improve? Is it because they don't know joseki? Or perhaps it's because they can't find the tesuji or do tsumego? If this was your answer,these aren't the reasons. Of course, joseki, tesuji, and tsumego are undeniably reliable methods for improvement, but before we even go there, we need to address the foundation: how to think in Go and understand shapes.

The proverbs I'll share with you contain fundamental concepts that will serve to grow your roots so that your future development is well supported and unhindered. If you do not know, understand, and grasp these go sayings, your studies in Joseki, Tesuji, and reading will be meaningless for your improvement. Not only will they not be effective for your progress, but it will also just be a waste of your time. But don't worry, because by the end of the series, you will have the foundational knowledge that will serve as the spring board for your continued success in go.

But who is this guy to make such a claim? Sure, I may not be a professional or anything close to it, but I reached 6 dan on Fox Weiqi and Tygem (the two largest Go servers in Asia) by following these guiding principles, and I believe that if you take these lessons to heart, that there is nothing stopping you from reaching a similar level or beyond.
