## Preface

Here's #20 out of the top 20 proverbs that will serve as the foundation for the start of your journey to Go mastery. I recommend reading this one first, and work your way up the list to get the most out of this series. By the end of the series, you will have the foundational knowledge that will serve as the spring board for your future success in go.

So let me ask you a question. What do you think is the reason that causes people not to improve? Is it because they don't know joseki? Or perhaps it's because they can't find the tesuji or do tsumego? If this was your answer,these aren't the reasons. Of course, joseki, tesuji, and tsumego are undeniably reliable methods for improvement, but before we even go there, we need to address the foundation: how to think in Go and understand shapes.

The 20 proverbs I'll share with you contain fundamental concepts that will serve to grow your roots so that your future development is well supported and unhindered. If you do not know, understand, and grasp these proverbs, your studies in Joseki, Tesuji, and reading will be meaningless for your improvement. Not only will they not be effective for your progress, but it will also just be a waste of your time. But don't worry, because here are the 20 proverbs that you need to know.

But who is this guy to make such a claim? Sure, I may not be a professional or anything close to it, but I've reached 6 dan on Fox Weiqi and Tygem (the two largest Go servers) by following these guiding principles, and I believe that if you take these lessons to heart, that there is nothing stopping you from reaching a similar level or beyond.
